# Kaleidoscope_Frontend_Compiler
This repository designs a frontend compiler that compiles the language into a LLVM Intermediate Representation(IR). The llvm IR can then be compiled with llvm to get theÂ desired output of the inputted code in Kaleidoscope language .

## Overview

The compiler processes Kaleidoscope source code, generating LLVM Intermediate Representation (IR). Key components include:

-   **Lexer:** Tokenizes the Kaleidoscope source code into recognizable units like keywords, identifiers, and numbers. This forms the foundation for syntax analysis by breaking raw input into manageable pieces.
-   **Parser:** Converts the sequence of tokens into a structured Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) that reflects the program's grammar. It handles expressions, definitions, and control flow constructs for further semantic processing.
-   **AST:** Represents the hierarchical structure of the program using nodes such as `FunctionAST` and `BinaryExprAST`. This intermediate structure allows easier transformation into backend representations.
-   **LLVM IR Generation:** Walks through the AST and translates it into LLVM Intermediate Representation (IR), a low-level platform-independent code format. The IR enables optimization and execution using the LLVM infrastructure.

## Kaleidoscope Language

-   Procedural language with function definitions and calls. 
-   Supports conditionals (`if`), loops (`for`), and basic math. 
-   Single data type: `double`. 
-   Allows external function declarations (`extern`). 

## LLVM

-   LLVM is used for its modularity, portability, and JIT compilation capabilities. 
-   The compiler frontend generates LLVM IR, which LLVM can then optimize and compile. 

## Example
**Source Code** 
```
def sq(b) b*b;
```
**LLVM IR**
```
define double @sq(double %b) {
entry:
  %multmp = fmul double %b, %b
  ret double %multmp
}
